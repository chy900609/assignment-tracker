I want to build a simple “Assignment Progress Tracker” web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Requirements:

Single-page web app (no backend).

Users can add an assignment with: title, course name, due date, and status (todo / in-progress / done).

Show the assignments in a table or card list.

Support filtering by status (all / todo / in-progress / done).

Data should be saved in browser localStorage so that reloading the page keeps the assignments.

The UI should look clean and modern, responsive on desktop and mobile.

Please generate: index.html, style.css, and main.js and explain how to run it locally.
Later, I will also need help deploying it (e.g., GitHub Pages or Vercel) and writing a short reflection about problems and how I fixed them.
